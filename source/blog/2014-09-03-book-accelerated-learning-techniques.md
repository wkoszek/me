This little and interesting book touches topics such as paraphrasing newly
read material, together with hints on how to stay focused.

There was a nice pearl about how to become a very literate person. Recipe
was:

- 1 book
- 1 poem
- 1 short story

I suspect I'll have to come up with a CS equivalent of this list.

Mind mapping was mentioned. Before I knew how it is called I was using it,
for things which I were to do right the next day. Being in bed and far away
from a pen, I tried to throw a pillow in the middle of a room while thinking
about specific problem/task. The next day right after waking up I questioned
the location of the pillow and immediately recalled what I was thinking the
previous night.

Tracy's books are interesting as they seemed backed by his research, so I
believe that whatever this book has got, it has been an effect of his more
careful studies across a wide span of literature.

I recommend to learning addicts.
