				<p>Since the first sentence in this book I knew it'd be a very interesting
lecture. Lets say that after the first sentence I knew I must read this book
no matter how bad it'll be :)</p>

<p>It was great, not to say "Excellent".</p>

<p>Sometimes I'm pretty surprised why people like Jonas bother to write books,
but I think it's just to try something different. And from boredom.</p>

<p>Book covers the entrepreneurial rising of Jonas, who looks like humble and
modest, but truly exceptional individual: a kid, who knew exactly what's
going to happen in his future from the very early years of his life.</p>

<p>Story about starting business at the hot-dog stand reminded me Warren
Buffet story of newspaper delivery. I'm pretty impressed how friendly US is
hard working people, including young kids.</p>

<p>Let me tell you – selling hot-dog in a self-made stand when younger than 18
in the 1995–2012 timeline would be … literally impossible. So not sure
how magical were '70s in the US, or how magical US was in general.  However,
author achieved that. Moreover, it was in New York City..</p>

<p>Very interesting thread is Jewish heritage of the author, and lots of casual
stories interleaved in the main text.</p>

<p>Main morals are probably to look around and search for things other people
don't see. Like Christmas trees.</p>

<p>Next thing is to follow grandma's advise and not give away too much of the
ownership of the business.</p>

<p>Against what daddy says, to share in business, since letting other guy do
business and share the plate can result in good deals.</p>

<p>The value of the team was emphasized. I was pretty surprised moving back and
forth from Harvard to NYC didn't kill author's business and that he actually
passed everything.</p>

<p>This I think is the single biggest proof about author's exceptional
abilities and brain capacity.</p>

<p>Sticking with old friends looks like a major strategy of the Jonas too.</p>

<p>The way several deals were make was interesting. Looks like even with
capital, and a bit of interest and concern, you can learn a lot. Author did
at least 2 bargains deals (with publishing company and with space for phone
callback thingies), where he had to pay nearly 0, and get lots of $$$ back.</p>

<p>Ideas for growing a company were interesting too, but I started to feel like
after this part of book, I'll start learning lots of dark knowledge about
Wall Street. I wasn't disappointed.</p>

<p>Looks like taking your company to IPO is like dealing with a group of guys,
who all know each other and hang out together, and have their own
communication channels for exchanging super-hot and top-secret information.</p>

<p>I was surprised that the number of VCs and law-firms which could handle this
sort of action in 90's was so small.</p>

<p>Unfortunately coupon for IDT services expired in 1998, and I think it
wouldn't have applied to used-books anyway. Oh well.</p>

<p>Howard, if you read this, I hope you know I trust IDT services are just OK
:)</p>
