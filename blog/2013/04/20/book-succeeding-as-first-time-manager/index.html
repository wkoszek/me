				<p>This was actually pretty good!</p>

<p>When you're relatively good at something, and you need to train somebody or
show the person how to execute particular task, this book can be really
helpful.</p>

<p>It especially targeted towards people being actual managers, however I must
say several of the hints were pretty useful for day-to-day corporate
operation.</p>

<p>Example:</p>

<p>In case of explaining complex chain of tasks which have to be executed in a
given order and sequence, and they have to be done certain way in order to
accomplish desired result, trick "I'm not sure if I made it clear; do you
think you could rephrase with your words what you think I meant…" is
perfect.</p>

<p>It's easier if you're a Polish immigrant with strong USSR-alike accent
(strong L, less flashy) it's even easier. Sometimes people just do it by
themselves, without asking.</p>

<p>Several times it occurred to me I got something completely different to what
I asked about. Especially in a inter-continental team where stuff is shared
over e-mail, managing complex topics can be challenging.</p>

<p>Having a respect to people is one of the challenging topics to me. When I
see somebody screwing things over and over and not thinking through the
solution, it makes me angry sometimes. In the old good days (not working in
the office), I could freely explode to my university colleagues and tell
them what I think about them.</p>

<p>Unfortunately – this doesn't work anymore.</p>

<p>Anyway: how to manage people in a software project still remains
undiscovered to me. It's funny thing to work in a hardware company, where
people weren't schooled in software engineering nor did they participate in
Open Source project. Basically coding style is new to them and it's hard
to blame them</p>

<p>I guess this is where a bit of process would be helpful; putting tools in
place for checking whether the style looks at least correctly from the
indention point of view would be good.</p>

<p>You can't figure out abstraction layer breakages that way; you can't correct
design that way. But at least you're able to guess what the intention of the
author was.</p>

<p>In general: Lohr's books I found particularly interesting. Maybe because the
topic is completely new to me.</p>
