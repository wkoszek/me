				<p>Didn't really know what to think about this book. Started just fine–nice
story about New York City and having fun. Author described his niche habit
of drawing things on the back of business cards, and how people felt it's
ridiculous.</p>

<p>His faith in doing something he liked and believed in was one of the
advices. This is a point of view not matching the interative, incremental
model of improvement and trying to walk over and adjust. He matched whatever
he wanted.</p>

<p>Funny thing is that I saw so many contradictions to young entrepreneur
bibles like "REWORK" and "Lean Startup", that it gave me a broader
perspective. Looks like just like within 2 engineers you get 3 proposed
solutions, with people writing about business you get only theirs
perspective. Here comes the strength of reading many books on the same
topic – you get confidence factor.</p>

<p>Like making sure idea is yours. Personally I like: "it's not the idea, it's
execution" model. Similarly, throwing ideas to other people and observing
their reaction. Is you get 10/10 fail rate in terms of sharing and querying
people about your idea, in my opinion this might turn out to be a valid
customer interest representation. Yet I see the point. Being Opera browser
users I look at w3schools.com statistics and I see ONLY 1.8%. So I look at
the Wikipedia page of usage share among browsers and I see some random
160,000,000 number of hits per month. Now applying 1.8% to this gives you
2,880,000 hits done with Opera. How would you feel knowing 2,8M people have
your program installed and actually do something with it?</p>

<p>How I ask?</p>

<p>…</p>

<p>Exactly. Anyway:</p>

<p>He touched an important point why was such a thing possible–model of
starting a business as a side project. This gives you (1) inability of
performing this 24/7 and (2) giving you freedom to innovate, since with
another bill paying job you're not limited to whatever customers request.
Good luck dear H1B visa holders!</p>

<p>However the thing about not depending that after quiting your daily job
things suddenly will become a road straight to Eden is true. I think
starting small and doing market probing of some sort and figuring out
whether people are interested is a better approach. Any good books on market
probing? Huh? Anybody?</p>

<p>The thing I feel was purposefully placed in a book are sexually-intensive
bridges between chapters, which act as a random thoughts brought and thrown
on the reader without a major sense and connection to the context of the
chapter. Personally I don't like it. However bring pretty sure MacLeod did
it to get more advertising and become more memorable–we can forgive that.</p>
