				<p>Let me keep it short. As short and concrete as your proposal should be.
I document my  examples with this years proposals, but the fact you see
title of your project here means nothing. These are just examples.</p>

<h3 id="project-title">Project title</h3>

<p>Nothing more here. Keep it short and precise. <strong><em>NTFS for FreeBSD</em></strong> is so
much different than <strong><em>Proposal for FreeBSD</em></strong>.  Positively different.</p>

<h3 id="short-description">Short description</h3>

<p>I always try to think that <strong>lesser is more</strong>.  Please keep it short. Very
short. Lets make it 2-sentence short. So short description can contain 1
sentence answer for each of the questions:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><strong>What this proposal is all about?</strong> Example: <em>I propose to improve
 FreeBSD support of filesystem X</em>; <em>I propose to improve 3 FreeBSD text
 utilities: grep(1), diff(1) and sed(1)</em>; *This proposal is about bringing
 support for CPU percentage limits".</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><strong>Why do you work on this project?</strong> Example: "I want to improve support
 for colorful ls(1) because current ls(1) is archaic"; "I want to improve
 FreeBSD ULE kernel scheduler to let me turn CPU off"* etc..</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Most of the short descriptions of the projects were surprisingly good.</p>

<h3 id="provide-real-name-and-surname">Provide real name and surname</h3>

<p>If possible, provided something that can be entered with limited set of
characters. Basically something that consists of a-zA-Z characters. The
reason is that we all have limited knowledge of the world and to save
ourselves lots of confusion, lets keep things simple. <strong>Please provide name
you'll be using over duration of the project</strong> If for some reason name from
the Google form is different that the one which you use on a daily basis,
please point it out in the proposal right away. This saves us some time too.</p>

<h3 id="e-mail-phone-irc-language">E-mail, phone, IRC, language</h3>

<p>Nothing special goes here. Whichever e-mail is fine, as long as you check it
on regular basic. Phone … probably won't be used, so I wouldn't be too
much afraid.</p>

<p>IRC is very useful – please mention precisely what's your typical nick when
where are you typically hanging out. <a href="http://www.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD</a> has
a dedicated IRC channel:</p>

<p><a href="irc://irc.efnet.nl#freebsd-soc">#freebsd-soc</a></p>

<p>You can meet actual mentors there. Once you join, you can feel free to ask
questions about GSOC.</p>

<h3 id="availability">Availability</h3>

<p>Provide relatively accurate availability: number of hours per week which you
can spend on the project. <strong>Be honest</strong>. We all know 8 hours per day of
actual coding is rare if you have school, assignments and real life. Yes,
doing what you want (<a href="http://www.freebsd.org">FreeBSD</a> is what you want,
right?) makes GSOC fun and you can spend more time on it, but don't make
this number higher artifically.</p>

<p>So here is important thing: <strong>I don't know what's the Google's expectation</strong>
for these numbers. If they expect "8 hours" …. well … you have to put 8
hours. Actually 8 might be right.</p>

<p>(I think the secret idea is to figure out which people can handle:
4[weeks]x4[days]x8[hours] schedule and steal them to Googleplex later)</p>

<p>%%inc/googleplex.html%%</p>

<p>Remember what those 160 hours mean: it means hours on refining the project,
answering e-mails, coordination, delays, waiting for your mentor to review
your work, figuring lots of obscure problems on your own, cursing BSD
community (well, other communities are bad too, but these are only BSDs that
are identified with <a href="http://www.mckusick.com/beastie/">Beastie</a>).</p>

<h3 id="bio">Bio</h3>

<p>This is important for me. Lets assume you're applying for the FreeBSD
project.  Some stuff which I'd expect you to write in a bio is:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p><em>Where and what do you study?</em> No explanation needed, right?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Have you ever worked professionally with computers?</em> If you did, it'd be
 worth mentioning what you did in the computer field (sys-admin,
 programming, Web development, graphics etc… – everything counts)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Do you already have experience with FreeBSD?</em> Examples: <strong>"I have no prior
 experience with FreeBSD"</strong>. This is perfectly valid statement. Other
 possibilities: <strong>"I work on FreeBSD in a free time for last 2 years; I have
 3 PRs submitted to FreeBSD bug database</strong></p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p><em>Which OS do you use on a daily basis?</em> Examples: <strong>"On a daily basis I use
 Windows, but I work on FreeBSD in VirtualBox"</strong>, <strong>"I work on GNU/Linux and
 I work remotely on FreeBSD server</strong>. Motivation behind this one is to
 assess, how painful will be bringing you on track with development
 environment and methodology.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="possible-mentor">Possible mentor</h3>

<p>This section is important to me, since it shows me you've researched the topic
well. Mentioning person who I know has an expertise related with your
proposal means you:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>follow the state-of-an-art work of the project, e.g.: that you
follow<a href="http://lists.freebsd.org">FreeBSD mailing lists</a> This is good:
shows your involvement in the community</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>know this person, since you're interested in his/her field and you've
contacted them already and they'll know you, if I ask them about you.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>you know this mentor in person, since he's a part of your university staff
or you're from the same country and you met him/her on the users conference.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>All of it is very good, since it shows you did some additional work to
actually help your proposal get accepted. <strong>Yes, you can actively lobby to
help your project</strong>. Basically: if I see you actively pushing people over
e-mail/IRC to help you with finding a mentor, this is a good sign.</p>

<p>If no activity is done from your side, this is bad.</p>

<p>IRC channels: <a href="irc://irc.efnet.nl#freebsd-soc">#freebsd-soc</a> and
<a href="irc://irc.efnet.pl#bsdcode">#bsdcode</a> on <a href="http://www.efnet.org">EFnet</a> are
the good place to hunt for mentors. You can ask on a mailing list too. We
have a <a href="http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/soc-status/">mailing list for this purpose
too</a>. However, I don't know
what its activity. So maybe ask on
have a
<a href="http://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/freebsd-hackers/">freebsd-hackers</a>. This
is probably pretty darn good way.</p>

<h3 id="project-description">Project Description</h3>

<p>Before you jump to the project description - I sort of miss "motivation"
section in this whole Google/Melange world. I think having a motivation backed by
good arguments is important.
So please include answers to: Why did you pick this project? Why do you
think it's interesting? This will help us understand what's driving you in
the GSOC train.</p>

<p>Anyway: I'd expect you to provide in-depth explanation of the project next.
A lot of projects are very different in between each other, and it's hard to
give a guideline, but just like they teach us all: introduction, content,
summary. This is how I would like to see GSOC project descriptions stated.
Some questions which you may find helpful: What's the project all about?
What does it solve? What current system/program doesn't have, that your
project will bring? Who will benefit from it?</p>

<p>Don't include all answers to all questions. "Project description" must be
technical, and not only having brave statements. So include technical
details too:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>What's wrongly implemented/architected in the current version of a
program/system. Why do you think so?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How your project will change that? What changes you'll bring? What
advantages will your new implementation have over the current state of
things? What disadvantages?</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>How do you plan to accomplish it? Will you concentrate of getting it all
running in whichever way (prototype)? Or you'll work with a mentor to
deliver great code which will be ready to be submitted to FreeBSD Subversion
repository?</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<h3 id="deliverables">Deliverables</h3>

<p>This is pretty short, but important. "Deliverable" is what you deliver. This
is more or less your schedule.</p>

<p>This isn't all that rocket science. I often have problems with assessing
time. So just take several assumptions: you have 160 hours. Let say 60 hours
are spent on: interruptions, coordination, reading manuals, documentation,
web pages, blog entries etc. which help you figure out what's the stuff
you're working on all about. Basically: 60 hours of cost related with
learning and catching up.</p>

<p>This gives you 100 hours for doing real work.</p>

<p>Typically you'd jump and start coding. Yes, I know, I know. However, it
would be good to have a sketch. It would be good to have a schedule.</p>

<p>Can't help you with that. Really. Joel Spolsky has something for you:
<a href="http://www.joelonsoftware.com/articles/fog0000000245.html">Painless
schedules</a></p>

<p>(By the way, he wrote tons of good stuff on his blog, which is summarized in
his two books:</p>

<p>%%inc/joelonsoftware.html%%
%%inc/moreonjoelonsoftware.html%%</p>

<p>Really excellent resources of knowledge, I can highly recommend)</p>

<p>Anyway, lets get back to deliverables. Example:</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Krash_Report prototype hacked in .sh; 5-line pass/fail report sent
through telnet(1) to HTTP server and displayed as pure HTML remotely" June,
7th, 2012.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improved Krash_Report #2 with client fetching full ASCII dump of kernel
failure and uploading it over telnet(1) to HTTP server. Displayed as HTML.
June, 14th, 212.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Improved Krash_Report #3 with server side implemented in PHP and letting
you to login and see the report in HTML form with CSS. June, 21st, 2012.</p>
  </li>
</ul>

<p>Note dates. Note specifics. Basically it's good to see whether you're on
track or not. It helps you, it helps your mentor.</p>

<h3 id="test-plan">Test Plan</h3>

<p>If you work on FreeBSD, ask first. In FreeBSD base we have some directories
that contain unit tests. Provide something that tests what you've done.
Having type 17 commands is always worse than typing 2-3 commands. In the
perfect case you'd provide 1 script that tests whatever you've made.</p>

<p>Of course that's very generalized case: if you have worked on very specific
kernel-level project, you'll have to provide other means of testing
framework.</p>

<p>However, you get the point. Provide your mentor a way to systematically test
your work and actively give you feedback.</p>

<p>If I have to type:</p>

<pre><code>./doit.sh
</code></pre>

<p>to observe what you've done already, it's much more likely I'll do it and
provide some feedback.</p>

<p>The end,
Hope that helps
