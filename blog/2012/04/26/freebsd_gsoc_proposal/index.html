				<p>So it has been a week since I reviewed 32 Google Summer of Code proposals for
FreeBSD.  If you don't know anything about it, try to see
<a href="http://www.google-melange.com">Google's Google Summer of Code website</a>.
In short it's a sponsored action that lets
students spend their summer (8 weeks) hacking Open Source projects, learning
new stuff, helping the community, growing as programmers and engineers and
additionally â€“ earning some additional money.</p>

<p>Organization gets $500 for accepted project. Students gets $5000 for accepted
project. In the middle of the deadline (midterm) students receive 50% of
their expected compensation: $2500. The rest comes at the end.</p>

<p>Since this was my 1st GSOC as a mentor and administrator, I decided to give
a short summary regarding what I think about GSoC:</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>It's a very valuable program for young people, who otherwise would have
 gone unnoticed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It's a good boost in the community. GSoC gave some more life in Open
 Source, since even if not for the pure technical joy (at first), people
 decide to hack stuff for fun and profit (in the middle-east countries $5000
 for 2 months of work is pretty damn good)</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It's a good give back from Google, who tends to steal lots of valuable
 people from the community. Young people bring some more fresh air into the
 projects, and sometimes are valuable in terms of providing feedback to the
 project from the point of view of newcomers.</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>Due to the point no. 3 I feel FreeBSD Project should pick projects smartly.
Basically we don't want to stretch Google's generosity too much. As I
mentioned before, students get $500 for the proposal acceptance. Thus, if
FreeBSD picks more projects, Google needs to spend more AND people from
FreeBSD community must spend more time on mentoring and coordination.</p>

<p>This is big responsibility that comes with a lot of work.</p>

<p>So, yes, we all do agree Google is very rich. However, we don't want to accept
proposals that which we know are not quite right. Don't get me wrong, it's not
that proposals get declined due to political reasons or our laziness. I do know
that some proposals for another Google event, Google Code-In, were very
good. However the amount of coordination that went into the event basically
overwhelmed the value that they were bringing.</p>

<p>In Google Code-In, sometimes I also saw right away that attitude of the
participant wasn't great. We had cases of Linux users applying for FreeBSD
projects and working on FreeBSD still now knowing, that FreeBSD isn't Linux.</p>

<p>Google Summer of Code is different. This is more serious event, since you
have older people working on projects. People are older and smarter,
projects are bigger and prices are bigger too.</p>

<p>We expect more from you. You have a chance to work with highly experienced
people, have fun and get some bonus points in your resume, so please spend some
time on your proposal and ideas.</p>

<p>Perform research on the topic.  Learn as much as possible before applying
(please, please, learn the basics of the project X; if you apply for project
X, use Google or Wikipedia and read page about X 10 times).  Look what
previous proposals looked like; compare your proposals with it.  Figure out
what people from previous years of GSoC did. Is their work available? Do you
want to work on stuff that other people started, but didn't finish? Look what
other people do nowadays. Is your project aligned with their work? Is there
an overlap? What's the interest in your project?  Are other people are
willing to review your work? Do you have any competition?</p>

<p>These questions seem easy, but they might be a key for understanding:</p>

<ul>
  <li><strong>If you really want to work on your project?</strong> There are a lot of things
 (devil is in the detail) that can be overlooked and your project may not be
 as fun as you initially think. Try to do your best to analyze the project
 from the ground-up. Maybe try to ask more experienced people. Do your best
 to figure out, what will really have to be done to accomplish your
 project.</li>
  <li><strong>Will you find an interest in your project?</strong> It is more motivating when
 your project is interesting to more people; at least more than 1 person
 (you). Basically, it is much better to see people giving you feedback and
 pushing you to actually work on The Thing.</li>
  <li><strong>Will you be able to find a mentor?</strong> Problem with projects like
 <a href="http://www.freebsd.org">The FreeBSD Project</a> is that a lot of people from
 the project are full-time professionals with limited amounts of time.
 Sometimes, you may find really bright idea, but you'll be unlucky due to all
 the Important People and Smart Individuals with an expertise in the area
 being busy developing Next Big Thing or just working on their
 contracts. Pick people who happen to be regularly present on the
 <a href="http://lists.freebsd.org/">FreeBSD mailing lists</a> and try to pick those
 who work in an area that overlaps with your project.</li>
  <li><strong>Will the work be useful after you finish it?</strong> Nothing more to add.</li>
</ul>

<p>Don't get me wrong - if I had submitted the proposal it wouldn't have been
perfect either. However, I think I'd more or less know the field. So once
again: mistakes are fine, but if you didn't analyze the case deeply enough, it
may turn out that your proposal is declined.</p>

<p>I think the reason people submit bad proposals is because they think the
acceptance rate is close to 90% successful. Indeed, it has success, but it's
not like 90% successful. Let make it 10% success. Or 5%.</p>

<p>But remember that working on the project is just like a normal job: you have
assumptions, you have requirements imposed by your proposal, and you have some
hints, but you also have a lot of work you must do by yourself.</p>
